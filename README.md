 This project is a frontend-focused music player application that emphasizes functionality and an engaging user experience. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the following key features and components:

1)Dynamic Song List: The songs array stores details of each song, including its name, file path, and cover image. These details are dynamically rendered into the DOM, ensuring that updates to the song list are reflected automatically.
2)Play/Pause Functionality: Users can toggle between playing and pausing the current song using the master play button. The button's icon dynamically changes to indicate the current state.
3)Progress Bar: A visually appealing progress bar tracks the playback progress of the song. The bar is updated in real time as the song plays and allows users to seek by dragging the slider.
4)Time Display: The current timestamp and total duration of the song are displayed alongside the progress bar. This feature provides users with clear playback information.
5)Next and Previous Buttons: Dedicated buttons enable users to navigate through the playlist. Clicking next or previous updates the current track and resets the playback time.
6)Individual Song Selection: Users can select and play any song from the playlist. When a song is clicked, it updates the player to show the selected song and its details.
7)Dynamic UI Updates: The bottom section of the player displays the currently playing song's name. Icons and styles across the player update dynamically to reflect the current state.
8)Custom Progress Bar Styling: The progress bar changes color as it progresses, adding a visually engaging element to the user interface.
9)Responsive and Interactive UI: The design includes a clean layout and interactive elements, enhancing usability and accessibility.
10)JavaScript Logic: Core functionalities are powered by JavaScript, which handles dynamic content rendering, event listeners for user interaction, and audio playback control.

This project is inspired by my love for music and is particularly dedicated to my admiration for Juice WRLD, whose tracks heavily influenced the playlist.
